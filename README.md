# Smart RSS

Smart RSS is addon that copies RSS reader from Opera 12.

Extension API does not allow to add both button next to url field (to Open RSS reader) and to url field (to add RSS of current site).  
That is why there are two extensions that communicate with each other:   

- Smart RSS  
- RSS Discovery  

Translations are in scripts/nls/*.js

For technical/bug reports add issues on GitHub.
