# Smart RSS

Smart RSS is addon that copies RSS reader from Opera 12.

Browser API does not allow to simultaneously add toolbar button (to open the reader) and url field icon (to add current site's feed).  
That is why there are two extensions that communicate with each other:   

- Smart RSS  
- RSS Discovery  

Translations are in `_locales/<locale>/messages.json`.

For technical/bug reports add [issues on GitHub](../../issues).
